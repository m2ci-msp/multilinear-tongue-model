# Multilinear Tongue Model

## Introduction

This repository contains a multilinear tongue shape model that was derived from MRI data.
We used the dataset of the [Ultrax project](http://www.ultrax-speech.org/) and the one of [Adam Baker] (http://adambaker.org/qmu.php) to create the model.

## Components

This repository provides you with the following files:

- tongue_model.yaml : This is the YAML version of the model. Here, the core tensor is encoded in Base64 to save some space.
- tongue_model.json : In this version, the model is saved in JSON format and no Base64 encoding is used.

## Using the model

Have a look at [multilinear-model-tools] (https://github.com/m2ci-msp/multilinear-model-tools) for example code using the model.
